      <p>Kanye West, legal name Ye, (born June 8, 1977, Atlanta, Georgia, U.S.), American producer, rapper, and fashion designer who parlayed his production success in the late 1990s and early 2000s into a career as a popular, critically acclaimed solo artist.</p>
      <p>West, the child of a photographer and former Black Panther father and a college professor mother, grew up in Chicago and attended Chicago State University for one year before dropping out to pursue a career in music. Early on he demonstrated his considerable abilities as a producer, contributing to Jermaine Dupri’s album Life in 1472 (1998) before relocating to the New York City area, where he made his name with his production work for Roc-A-Fella Records, especially on rapper Jay-Z’s album Blueprint (2001). West’s skillful use of accelerated sample-based beats soon made him much in demand as a producer, but he struggled to be allowed to make his own recordings (partly because of the perception that his middle-class background denied him credibility as a rapper). When he finally released his debut solo album, The College Dropout (2004), it was massively successful: sales soared, and critics gushed over its sonic sophistication and clever wordplay, which blended humour, faith, insight, and political awareness on songs such as “Through the Wire” and the gospel-choir-backed “Jesus Walks.” The latter cut won a Grammy Award for best rap song in 2005, and West also picked up awards that year for best rap album and best rhythm-and-blues song (as one of the songwriters of Alicia Keys’s “You Don’t Know My Name”).</p>

      <p>There are multi-hyphenates, and then there’s Kanye West. Raised in Chicago, the outspoken artist rose to fame with his rhythmically adventurous production for Jay-Z, Ludacris, Common, Talib Kweli, and many others, then channeled his own rhymes into his 2004 debut album, The College Dropout. His 2010 hip-hop opus My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy and 2013’s minimalist, Rick Rubin–produced Yeezus built on his introspective, bombastic charm. Whether recontextualizing classic R&B artists like Ray Charles and Nina Simone or building magnetic fusions of hip-hop, electronica, and indie rock, West continues to make captivating, soulful statements.</p>

      <p>Kanye West knew from the start that his style would play a huge part in his persona. And with a debut album titled The College Dropout, he dressed accordingly. Kanye presented himself as a preppy-leaning backpack rapper with a penchant for Polo, which was greatly influenced by Chicago’s ​​Reggieknow, a well-dressed Lo-head and illustrator graffiti who threw Dam Dare parties and dressed unlike most of his peers at the time. Kanye wore popped collars, bright colors, pink polos, corduroy blazers, rare sneakers, and an actual Louis Vuitton backpack. Polo has always been a staple within Black culture, and the backpack rapper look wasn’t an entirely new concept, but Kanye’s preppy style was different from how his peers dressed in the early 2000s (oversized T-shirts, baggy jeans, matching denim sets). And it resonated with fans, who not only embraced his music but his style, too.—Aria Hughes</p>
